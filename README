Wikro is a small wiki system. The name is made up of the terms Wiki 
and Micro.

The design goals of the Wikro system are:
* A single file for easy deployment (exanding when run first time)
* Simple and fast

From a technical perspective the system is solely written in PHP with 
a SQLite database as backend. PHP is chosen because it is the most common 
web language (as far as I know). The SQLite backend is chosen because of 
the simplicity (it is easy to backup and it is fast). Furthermore the 
Wikro system is build for small websites, which does not benefit that 
much from using a large enterprise database backend.
